- Proper headers were generated, inconsistent values replaced, and 'Qty' converted to absolute values to handle negative numbers.
### Date Table Generation with Power Query:
- A Date Table was generated to achieve unique dates crucial for further analytics.
### Fiscal Months and Quarters Derivation:
- Power Pivot was used to create precise fiscal time periods aligned with AtliQ Hardwareâ€™s fiscal year for accurate analysis.
### Data Modeling:
- Power Pivot was utilized to connect dimension and fact tables to establish relationships.
### Supplementary Data Incorporation:
- Power Pivot was used to integrate supplementary data into existing models, enhancing analytical capabilities.
### DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):
- DAX was used to create dynamic calculated columns for in-depth analysis.
### Pivot Table:
- Pivot Tables were employed to create insightful reports.
### Conditional Formatting:
- Applied conditional formatting to clearly highlight key figures.

### Profit and Loss (P&L) Report by Fiscal Years:
- Significant growth in net sales from 2019 to 2021.
- COGS increased at a slightly higher rate than net sales, contributing to a decline in GM%.
- Although gross margin increased in absolute terms, the slight decline in GM% indicates a decrease in profitability per dollar of sales in 2021 compared to 2020.
### Profit and Loss (P&L) Report by Countries/Markets:
- 2021 Top Markets by Net Sales:
  - India: $161.3M
  - USA: $87.8M
  - South Korea: $49.0M
- Profitability Insights:
  - India, USA, and South Korea contribute significantly to total net sales but have lower GM% due to higher COGS. For these countries, prioritization of cost reduction strategies, possibly by streamlining operations, renegotiating supplier contracts, or optimizing logistics can be done.
  - Countries like New Zealand, Japan, and the UK are most profitable in terms of GM%, indicating efficient cost management or strong pricing power.
  - Germany and Norway have the lowest GM%, possibly due to inefficiencies or competitive pricing pressures.
  - Growth opportunities in regions that currently contribute less to sales but show potential for high margins should also be explored while focusing on top-performing markets.
### Profit and Loss (P&L) Report by Months:
- Net sales grew significantly from 2019 to 2021, with an increase of about 584.6%.
- The growth was accompanied by an increase in COGS, leading to a decline in GM% from 2019 to 2021. Periodic reviews and negotiations with suppliers might help in managing these costs better.
- Sales peaked in October, November, and December in all three fiscal years, suggesting seasonality. Understanding these trends and planning inventory, marketing, and operations accordingly can help in maximizing sales and profitability during peak periods.
